SimpleRepository:
- return info about external uri?
- error handling
- checkin epatches

Storages:
- non blob storage!
- dependencies on model element level
- internally revision per model element

Repository:
- refactoring (moving/renaming models)

Misc:
- workaround for loading GMF notation instances

EPatch:
- does not support multiple root elements per model, problem?
- uses last segment of a resource uri only, how can we associate this change with stored models?

GraphDB:
- use http://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints as graphdb abstraction instead of neo4j. resolves license issues
