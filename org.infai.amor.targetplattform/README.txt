Development
============

This project contains all dependencies of the AMOR backend and command line client. 
To use these dependecies instead of your locally installed plugins, follow these steps in Eclipse:

* open targetplattform.target 
* click the upper right link 'Set as target plattform'


Export
======

Export the needed AMOR backend bundles as a standalone windows application (for now) from Eclipse:
- right mouse click on this project
- select "Export"
- select "Eclipse Product"
- select a directory outside of this project
- run the exported amorbackend.exe
- PROFIT! :)
