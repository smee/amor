/**
 * <p>
 * RemoteOSGiService provides transparent access to services on remote service
 * platforms. It uses SLP as underlying discovery protocol. Local services can
 * be registered for remoting, applications can register listeners for
 * <code>ServiceTypes</code> to be informed whenever matching services have been
 * discovered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As soon as a service has been discovered and the listener has been informed,
 * the application can fetch the service. In the default case, the service
 * interface is transferred to the receiving peer together with an optional
 * smart proxy class and optional injections. The service then builds a proxy
 * bundle and registers it with the local framework so that the application can
 * get a service reference as if the service was local. Internally, all methods
 * of the service interface are implemented as remote method calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Services can define smart proxies to move some parts of the code to the
 * client. This is done by an abstract class. All implemented method will be
 * executed on the client, abstract methods will be implemented by remote method
 * calls. Moving parts of the code to the client can be useful for saving
 * service provider platform's resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Injections are used if the service interface uses classes as method arguments
 * that are not expected to be present on client side. These classes will be
 * automatically injected into the proxy bundle. The registrator can manually
 * inject additional classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With version 0.5, there is also the possibility to register a service with
 * the MIGRATE_BUNDLE policy. In this case, the bundle that provides the service
 * is moved to the requesting peer.
 * </p>
